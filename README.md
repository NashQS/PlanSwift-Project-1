# Project Overview
This project involved the creation of a detailed material schedule for a cottage construction using PlanSwift, a software tool for estimating and material takeoff. The project focuses on key construction elements such as brickwork, foundation, superstructure, and sundries, with a total project cost of $9,829.88. The material schedule was used to analyze quantities and costs, aiding in decision-making and project planning.

# Tools
The project was produced using PlanSwift 10.

The data from PlanSwift was integrated to Excel

# Project Steps
## 1.Project Planning
    Initial plans and design layouts for the cottage were reviewed to determine material and cost estimation requirements.
   
## 2.Takeoff Using PlanSwift
    Uploaded digital plans of the cottage into PlanSwift.
    Used PlanSwift tools to trace and measure areas for brickwork, concrete, and other foundation elements.
    Measured quantities of bricks, sand, cement, and other materials from the plan.
    Assigned unit costs to each material in PlanSwift for automatic cost calculations.

## 3.Material Quantities and Costs
    Extracted quantities such as:
    Bricks: Total of 17,845 bricks.
    Concrete: Required 9 m³ for slabs, 6 m³ for external footing, 2 m³ for internal footing.
    Other materials: Meshwire, damp proof membrane (DPM), sand, cement, stone, and DPC (Damp Proof Course).
    Each element was associated with cost, allowing the generation of a full cost breakdown for the project.

## 4.Integration with Excel
    Exported the material takeoff data from PlanSwift to Excel for further analysis.
    Used Excel to generate additional calculations, graphs, and visualizations of cost distribution and material usage.
    Excel was also used for producing reports with tables summarizing key material quantities and total costs.

## 5.Cost Analysis and Visualization
    Data from PlanSwift was visualized using Excel for graphs such as:
    Bar graphs for material quantities (sand, cement, stone, meshwire, etc.).
    Pivot table cost analysis
